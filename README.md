Companion mode: Gentle Guidance for Mindful Watching
## Project Overview
Companion Mode is a feature designed to make YouTube watching more mindful and intentional, allowing users to stay in control of their time. The mode includes character selection, time setting, and custom reminders to promote healthier screen habits.
## Tools Used
*Figma*: For UI/UX design and prototyping.
Problem Statement:
Users, often unintentionally spend their time binge watching which hinders their productivity .While ,engagement is important but it often hinders users lifestyle .We need a more mindful interface that encourages healthier screen habits but also does not break the viewing experience.
Concept Overview:
Our concept is to make watching more mindful rather than compulsive .what we tried to do is that users don’t forget for what they are on the platform and they are not stuck in the loop hole of watching mindlessly.
•	First we have introduced a new mode in youtube that is companion mode.
•	Where users are set to choose between three characters
Based on my research if we talk about majority of users what they use youtube we have divided it into three to keep it simple and straightforward.
	Focussy: a character that represents the user that are here on the platform to learn something which requires high focus.
	Chill out: a character that represents the users that are on the platform to relax and chill out for a bit or those who want to escape from the reality.
	Explorer: a character that represents the curious ones that are here to learn something new or to fill up their curious minds,
•	Once the character are selected users are supposed to define the goal for what they are looking for and set their desired time .They get to choose how many hours they want to spend on the platform.
•	After that ,there is the most interesting option customized reminder something that they wont be able to ignore although its optional but it can help in making user feel more in control with their time and their choices.
•	Another factor that affects the users subconscious mind indirectly is that as they have set the limit each character has their assigned colour and as the time starts it is in light but as you see the time is about to hit to the end then it gets darker gradually.
User Flow:
1.	User picks a character
2.	Enters goal ,time and custom message
3.	Watching interface begins
4.	Reminder pops up when time’s up
5.	Uses takes a break or delays it.

 
 
 
Conclusion:
By introducing companion mode we aim towards a more balanced and intentional approach towards video watching allowing users to stay in control of their time.
